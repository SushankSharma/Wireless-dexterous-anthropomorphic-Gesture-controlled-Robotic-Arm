🚨 Warning: Watching this video may result in a sudden urge to build your own robotic arm! 🚨

## Introduction 🤖
This project is all about redefining the interaction between human gestures and the digital world. 🤝 Our goal is to create a **wireless-dexterous-anthropomorphic-gesture-controlled-robotic-arm** that mimics human hand gestures and performs various tasks in real-time. 🤖

## How it works 🤔
1. The Tx and Rx circuit attempt to connect via the **NRF24L01** transceiver module.
2. After a successful connection, the user can transmit hand gestures using a glove.
3. The transmitted gestures control the movement of the robotic arm.
4. The hardware interacts with the system and external environment using an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller.

## Requirements 💻
- Arduino Nano
- NRF24L01 Transceiver Module
- 3D Printer
- STL Files
- Glove
- Flex Sensors (*10)
- MG996 Servo Motors

## Let's get started 🚀

>1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git
```
>2. Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
>3. Upload the code to the Arduino Nano Microcontroller.
>4. Put on the glove and control the movement of the robotic arm using hand gestures.
