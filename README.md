# 🤖 The Future of Robotic Arms is Here!

## Introduction 🤖
This project is all about redefining the interaction between human gestures and the digital world. 🤝 Our goal is to create a **wireless-dexterous-anthropomorphic-gesture-controlled-robotic-arm** that mimics human hand gestures and performs various tasks in real-time. 🤖

## How it works 🤔
1. The Tx and Rx circuit attempt to connect via the **NRF24L01** transceiver module.
2. After a successful connection, the user can transmit hand gestures using a glove.
3. The transmitted gestures control the movement of the robotic arm.
4. The hardware interacts with the system and external environment using an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller.

## Requirements 💻
- Arduino Nano
- NRF24L01 Transceiver Module
- 3D Printer
- STL Files
- Glove
- Flex Sensors (*10)
- MG996 Servo Motors
