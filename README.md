Here the main aim is to create a systematic approach to quantify the anthropomorphism of robotic hands. Once the system is activated, each Tx and Rx circuit attempts to connect via the transceiver module of the NRF24L01 module. 
After a successful connection, the user can transmit various hand gestures that can be used to control the robotic arm in real-time.

> This project only covers the gripping part of the robotic arm and mimics human anthropomorphic
gesturesâ€”the generated STL files are fed to the Cura software for slicing and printed using a 3-D printer.
> It is presently a working robotic hand that can mimic gestures given by a human hand wirelessly. The

Arduino microcontroller module allows input and output mechanisms to interact with the system and the external environment. 
The hardware responds successfully to the interaction of both the transmitter system and the receiver system. This project finally can control the movement by using the glove to
integrate with hand and teleoperate by RF wireless module using simple human hand gestures. 
This study has shown that nearly 96% of the transmitted signal is configured, and it redefines the interaction between simple human gestures and the digital world.
